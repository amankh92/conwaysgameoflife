# conwaysgameoflife
An implementation of Conway's game of life in Java. 

This repository contains the core logic and a main class with a sample input. Feel free to play around with it and make/suggest changes if any. Currently, the output for each iteration of the game is printed without removing the output  from the previous iteration because I couldn't find a way to do it. If you know how to do it, please be generous!

## Setup
Just import it as a gradle project in IntelliJ and you're good to go!
